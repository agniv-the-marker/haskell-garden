### NOTE: Most of my notes are actually down on paper, and I've done all the exercises on paper for the sake of end of year exams. This is not maintained, and I've not actually found using a graph-based note-taking system that good for learning math/cs, for me personally. However, for other notes, I like it (to come)

This garden will contain my (agniv's) notes on Haskell, following some of the [course material from Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2023-2024/fp/), the [official guide](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/#set-up-a-haskell-development-environment) for haskell, and [learn you a haskell for a great good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)!

Use [[precursor/installing haskell\|installing haskell]] to install, and check out [[precursor/ide support\|ide support]] for vs-code specific extensions. Then you should check out [[precursor/running haskell\|running haskell]] for, well, obvious reasons. The vs-code extension needs vs-code to be reloaded so it can do `runghc`, because this skips over any complaints from the window's defender.

And yes, the site's favicon [3d_haskell.svg](https://github.com/agniv-the-marker/functional-programming/blob/main/3d_haskell.svg) is a poorly ai-generated rendition of a 3d logo for haskell :P. If you want to get back, click [here](agniv.me/obi).

To see the specifics:

- Oxford's course material (course notes) correlates with [[ox_fp/oxford functional programming\|oxford functional programming]].
