This garden will contain my notes on Haskell, following some of the [course material from Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2023-2024/fp/), the [official guide](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/#set-up-a-haskell-development-environment) for haskell, and [learn you a haskell for a great good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)!

Use [[precursor/installing haskell\|installing haskell]] to install, and check out [[precursor/ide support\|ide support]] for vs-code specific extensions. Then you should check out [[precursor/running haskell\|running haskell]] for, well, obvious reasons. The vs-code extension needs vs-code to be reloaded so it can do `runghc`, because this skips over any complaints from the window's defender.

To see the specifics:

- Oxford's course material ([fp_notes.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O1Oq5g9DEug96MbidHu_iYOwaDCYYNa2/view?usp=sharing)) correlates with [[ox_fp/oxford functional programming\|oxford functional programming]]
