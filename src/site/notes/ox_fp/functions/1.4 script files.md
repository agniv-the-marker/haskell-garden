When we want to reference custom definitions, we need to make a header file, which Haskell calls a script file and utilizes the `*.lhs` extension for *literate* haskell script. More on this can be found at the [haskell wiki literate programming page](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming). Ultimately:

~~(I've seen his house, it's kind of boxy)~~

In fact, this is so customized to 'human beings' that to make clear which sections are code/actual definitions and not comments, you utilize either carets `>` (affectionately called bird tracks), which you have to add a newline between a program line and a comment:

```haskell
comments go here

> defns

and can go here
```

Or,, you can do the 'human' way:

```haskell
comments

\begin{code}
defns
\end{code}

comments
```

Yeah, you can really tell who this language was made for and who made it.

The textbook calls this commenting format to be

> a Good Thing by all Right Thinking People.

If you want to maintain consistency with extensions, you can declare definitions within `*.hs` files because *all lines are definition lines*. See [[precursor/conventions\|conventions]] for how to instead put comments with dashes and curly braces.
