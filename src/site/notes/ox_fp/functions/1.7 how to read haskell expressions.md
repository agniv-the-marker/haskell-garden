If you've read math before, it's essentially the same, but with a little more rules. $f\ x$ means applying a function $f$ to a value $x$, reading from left to right. So, be careful if you're doing $f\ x\ y$, as this is essentially $f(x)$ being applied to $y$, meaning $f(x)$ returns a function.

There are a few exceptions for certain operators, because otherwise Haskell would suck. Consider $+$. We want to write $x + y$, not $+\ x\ y.$ As for order of operations with this reframing, operators happen after function calls, meaning $p\ q + r\ s$ is the same as $p(q) + r(s)$, instead of $p(q + r)(s)$. The other operator which this is useful for is composition $\circ$:

```haskell
f . g = (.) f g -- f(g) should return a function
(f . g) x = (.) f g x -- f(g(x))
f . g x = f . (g x) -- expects g(x) to be a function
```
