We define well formedness to be the 'readability' of the language, so to speak, namely the style guide and such. There's also well typed expressions, which allows us to make sure that the inputs to our functions are correct regardless of their actual value. These are both things that can be caught with glazed over eyes, as you don't actually have to run the code to catch these.
