Going back to the `Pair` and `Either` type we used in [[ox_fp/expressions/3.3 types\|3.3 types]], we need some way to access the first/second element:

```haskell
first :: Pair a b -> a
first (Pair x y) = x -- Diff variables since a/b are types and x/y are variables referring to values
second :: Pair a b -> b
second (Pair x y) -> y

left :: Either a b -> a
left (Left x) = x
right :: Either a b -> b
right (Right y) = y
```

This is very natural, similar to the c++ syntax but translated over into haskell. These are called selectors. However, we probably want discriminators to make sure we're using left and right correctly:

```haskell
isLeft :: Either a b -> Bool
isLeft (Left x) = True
isLeft (Right x) = False 
```

These fall under the general class of types called deconstructors, though they're also called destructors as well. We use these to write functions, and can be nonunique.
