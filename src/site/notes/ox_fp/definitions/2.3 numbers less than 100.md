We're getting up there! The pattern for digits less than a hundred is the tens digit is equal to $n // 10$ and the units digit is $n \pmod{10}$. In code notation, this is $div\ n\ 10$ and $mod\ n\ 10.$ Our function will then have the signature:

```haskell
digits2 :: Int -> (Int, Int)
digits2 n = (div n 10, mod n 10) -- Does division twice...
digits2 n = (n `div` 10, n `mod` 10) -- What's this?
```

The second way of writing it uses back quotes \` to convert the operators `div, mod` into infix operators, so it can be wrapped by its arguments. Note that (just as in most languages, I think), there is already a built-in function to do this called `divMod`:

```haskell
p `divMod` q == (p `div` q, p `mod` q) -- Faster, as its a single division.

digits2 n = n `divMod` 10 -- perfection. 
```

So to combine these we need:

```haskell
convert2 :: Int -> String
convert2 = combine2 . digits2

combine2 :: (Int, Int) -> String
combine2 (t, u)
 | t == 0           = units u
 | t == 1           = teens u
 | u == 0           = tens t
 | otherwise        = tens t ++ "-" ++ units u
```

Again, we're using a switch statement here to split it up into its different cases. The rest of the functions like teens and tens are the same as units:

```haskell
teens, tens :: Int -> String -- Same type
teens u = teenStrings!!u
tens t = tenStrings!!(t-2)

teenStrings :: [String]
teenStrings = ["ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen" ]

tenStrings :: [String]
tenStrings = ["twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]
```
