So far we've really only dealt with functions, so let's look at more variables, specifically variables that live within the scope of a function. Haskell's methodology for this is via `let`:

```haskell
f1 n = let phi    = (1 + root5) / 2
           phibar = -1/phi
           root5  = sqrt 5
       in (phi^n - phibar^n) / root5
```

Note that `let` can be used to define functions and other objects. However, the opposite of this is via `where`:

```haskell
f1 n = (phi^n - phibar^n) / root5
       where phi    = (1 + root5)/2
             phibar = -1/phi
             root5  = sqrt 5
```

Haskell is a language written by mathematicians, thanks Christopher Strachey. 

Note that the ordering seems to be pretty minimal, i.e. `root5` is defined at the end. This is... ok, but to make it more readable:

```haskell
f1 n = (phi^n - phibar^n) / root5
       where phi = (1 + root5)/2
                where root5 = sqrt 5
             phibar = -1/phi
```

This is fine because `where` is appended after an equality, and setting variables counts as that.
