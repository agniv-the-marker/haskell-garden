Haskell's offside rule has to do with structure/whitespace/ordering of operations/etc. Specifically, things that are "off to the side" execute later. Roughly, equations start first, then the rest of the equation (like where clauses) appear to the right, since no one would say "Where x = 2, x^2." One can technically utilize curly braces:

```haskell
five = let {two = 1+1; three = 1+two} in two + three
five = two + three where {two = 1+1; three=1+two}
```

This is sort of like a `c++` style. Most of the time utilizing newlines makes the code more human readable.

This section feels like it was implicit throughout but made confusing once made explicit.
