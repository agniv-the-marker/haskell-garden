I'm using vscode simply because it's what I'm used to. Ultimately [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) for haskell is all you need, but I'll also install [haskell linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.haskell-linter) because I like clean code. That seems like all there is to it, and I'll update this more if needed.

You have to make a haskell file for the actual extensions to properly kick in and load and find all relevant PATHs, and make sure to have `hlint` installed for the linter to work out.
